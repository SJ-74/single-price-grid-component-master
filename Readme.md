## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Learned about vertical align and filter property which was new for me. Proud of these two pieces of code.


```css
.text--light{

    vertical-align : 0.25em;
    opacity : 0.75;

}
.button{

    filter: drop-shadow(1px 10px 10px #0000002c);

}
```

### Continued development

Continuing forward, I'd like to focus on grid, sub-grid and shadow properties in CSS.
